I did end up making some progress on last night's endeavor - found a website with a few examples of how to access data using the BLS api.  I'm eager to get into that and play/learn, but the several hours I spent on looking for and at different things caused me to step back and reflect.  That, coupled with the fact that I dreamt I was coding all night last night has me thinking that it may be best to slow down.  Although I think there is value to jumping into the deep end, I don't want doing that to impede my ability to learn somewhat sequentially.  So, just so that I'm doing something more than writihg and reflecting on yesterday's experience, I came up with an idea.  I figured that it might be good to practice branching, pull requests and merges.  I thought a fun way to do this would be to start of list of some of my favorite scenes from movies and add to them using the pull request/merge process.  I'll start with one of my favorite movis of all time:

[The Big Lebowski](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFxw-hkr4cI) - I absolutely love how Brandt conveys his disdain for _the Dude_ with nothing more than a shoulder shrug
[Predator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TU7CDejp6Lw) - This scenes has one of the most oft mimicked lines from the Schwarzenegger.  It's defintely time to get to the chopper.
