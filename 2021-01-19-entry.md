I recently had a child who will be 1 years old on Feb 19th. I am originally from Williamston, Mi (antique capitol of Michigan) which is about 20 miles east of Lansing.
I play the bass guitar, like reading and work on art whenever I have time.  I currently work as a Risk Reporting Analyst for the commercial division of a large regional bank.  
I use SAS and excel a lot in my job, data mining and creating user interfaces and visualizations.  I've recently returned to GVSU to obtain an undergraduate degree in economics, 
and eventually get a master's degree.
When I look at the learning objectives, I fee like my strengths will be in data normalization and mining.  I also have a pretty good handle on arrays and macros, at least how they
work in excel and SAS.  I've found that the concepts were difficult when I learned them, but now it's just a matter of changing the syntax to accommodate the language being used.
The most exciting recent project I was involved with was our Excess over Guideline reporting.  It required a complete rework in SAS.  From there, I built out an interface in tableau 
for users to interact with.  There were a large number of challenges, which makes the success of having completed it very satisfying.  Of course, I say "completing it," but there is
no report in my world that is ever "finished," just finished for now.
A large reason for taking this class comes from the hope that I will be able to leverage my experiences here in my workplace.  Although I'm really excited about learning R and 
all it can do, I want to bring more value in my role to the organization I work for.  As part of that pursuit, I'm expecting that this class will help me think of new ways of looking
at the data I already work with day-to-day and inform how I both digest the data and how I present it moving forward.
I don't have any special considerations that you need to be made aware of.
