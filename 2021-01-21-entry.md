I downloaded R to my PC and decided to crack it open.  I have some friends that started programming in Python, which I must admit causes some level of envy.  Of course, I couldn't be the only one amongst us who hadn't at least tried dabbling with the program.  I found the program difficult to use, but I really think that's just part of the process.  Through this, I was introduced to the idea of obtaining JSON data from the internet.  One of my more code savvy counterparts created a program that sifts through a number of websites to find the best price on a movie he's interested in purchasing.  He realized when he was going through Amazon that he was still getting movies from stores, but Amazon was controlling a markup **AND** the seller was getting some bonus from selling through Amazon.  Dan couldn't stand this, so he came up with a python program that allowed him to cut out the middle-man (AMAZON).

Whatever about his project, that's a whole other story, but it made me start thinking about the capabilities of R.  What I found which reminded me a lot of Python, is that there are libraries that allow certain properties and operations to be called on, but they don't come pre-loaded.  :*(

This concept took me a bit to get used to when I first started playing with Python, but I used excel and vba a lot at work and when I started to think about it, this wasn't so different from the vba editor's object libraries.  So, the next step is answering the quandry "what do I need to accomplish the desired operation."  I started with what I thought might be relatively simple, well, let me back up.  I started where many of my friends who code tend to start now-a-days - YouTube U.  ** Side Note: ** when people at work try to compliment me for my sas coding, I remind them that I am a much better google-searcher than I am a programmer.

Anyway, I started by watching a video about [importing data from a JSON](https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=importing+data+into+using+R+and+json&&view=detail&mid=12C3EFD783A456FDB61512C3EFD783A456FDB615&&FORM=VRDGAR&ru=%2Fvideos%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dimporting%2Bdata%2Binto%2Busing%2BR%2Band%2Bjson%26FORM%3DHDRSC4) . . . which as luck would have it was a tutorial on grabbing data from the users github repository.  I wanted to do something a touch more interesting than that, so I went after grabbing data from the [bureau of labor statistic](https://data.bls.gov).  In the end, it got a little too late and before I knew it I was in a rabbit hole of video after video and I feel no closer to an answer myself, save for that fact that everything I'm reading makes it seem totally doable.  I just need to keep digging.
